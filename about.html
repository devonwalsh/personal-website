    <h1>About Devon</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I've spent more than a decade working at technology companies in data-related roles: organizing, monitoring, and analyzing information to tell useful stories about what's happening in the business.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a full-time software engineering student at Flatiron School, looking to marry my existing skills and experience with broader coding know-how, so I can continue to grow and work on interesting projects in tech.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I like baking, gaming, and watching Prestige Televisionâ„¢.</p>
